Overview
----------------
Search engine for AirBnB listings. Targeted on NYC's 80k listings.
Final assignment of the "Gestione dell'informazione" course at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. Academic year 2023-2024.

How to move
----------------
If you are lucky, your terminal provides mouse support: click and should work out-of-the-box, enabling you to interact with widgets though clicks. Scrolling unfortunatly, doesn't work; to scroll a list just use arrows as described below.

Arrows (UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT) move the cursor in a given direction.
TAB moves the cursor from the search area to the bottom controls, when possible (eg. while reading this page no search area is available, so the focus can't be moved).

Room Type
----------------
Room type is an enumerated type, which values are pre-defined by AirBnb: private room, shared room, hotel room, entire home/apt. Make sure to write it precisely inside the filter field, since no autocompletion is provided.

Sentiment Classes
----------------
Sentiment analysis is made possible through a BERT multi-class classifier, trained on fine-grained, human annotated, GoEmotions dataset.
Submit queries with sentiment tags by juxtaposing tags separated by a space.

27 classes are available: admiration amusement amusement anger annoyance approval caring confusion curiosity desire disappointment disapproval disgust embarrassment excitement fear gratitude grief joy love nervousness optimism pride realization relief remorse sadness surprise neutral
